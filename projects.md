# Course Projects for COM580: Web Application Development
Professor [Karl Stolley](http://karlstolley.com), Illinois Institute of Technology, Spring 2011

### Project 1 (Due 2/14/11): Rich UX Interface Design

For this project, you will build the front end/user interface as a
prototype-based proposal for a Web application. It should make use of HTML5 and
jQuery, and perhaps CSS3 on the "experience layer" (Cederholm).

####Project 1 Deliverables
  * A GitHub Repository showcasing your work from start to finish, featuring frequent, well-crafted commits
  * Weekly tags in GitHub marking your progress on the project
  * The finished prototype, either posted to the Web or in test-ready download form from GitHub, tagged with 'final-prototype'
  * Weekly in-progress presentations/demonstrations (on 1/24, 1/31, and 2/7)
  * Final presentation on 2/14

Note: The Web Applications that will make up the team projects from project two will be chosen from the prototype/proposals in project one. So be awesome.

### Project 2 (Due 4/4/11): Web Application

### Project 3 (Due Week of 5/2/11): Mobile Interface Design
