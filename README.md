# Course Syllabus and Materials for COM580: Web Application Development
Professor Karl Stolley, Illinois Institute of Technology

Rather than do a course website/wiki as I usually do, for this course I'm making all materials available as a Git repository; students may fork this repository and make changes/pull requests--ensuring the functionality of the wiki while moving away from the problems of long-term maintenance that wikis inevitably face (at least if you prefer to host them yourself, as I do).
